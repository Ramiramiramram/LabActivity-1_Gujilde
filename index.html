    <h2> by Calliope Mori</h2>
    <p style="font-size:130%; font-weight: 500;">
        <br>We'd run
        <br>Right through
        <br>Those nights
        <br>I'll never find my way back to you inside this labyrinth of lights
        <br><br>There was madness
        <br>In the meaning
        <br><br>Never laughless
        <br>We were screaming at the top of our lungs to the numbness
        <br>This city never died
        <br><br>I'll fly
        <br>No proof
        <br>Those heights
        <br><br>I'll never find another chance to say "hey, thanks for saving my life"
        <br>I was hopeless
        <br>It was stinging
        <br><br>Running roadless
        <br>We were singing at the top of our lungs to the numbness
        <br>This city never died
        <br><br>What was the root of it all?
        <br>I couldn't say
        <br>Used to jump and then fall
        <br>Rugged and clich√©d
        <br><br>Would shrug it off without complaint, not a sound
        <br>No use in trying to find friends, 'cause in the end nobody sticks around
        <br><br>It's when you shoved yourself into a crowded place
        <br>That you turned around and found yourself in love in outer space
        <br><br>Cue the reckless nights, no strings
        <br>Laughing at our own dreams
        <br>Just what the hell was so funny?
        <br><br>Bark up the wrong tree, stumble, used to falling great heights
        <br>Amidst a concrete jungle, singing 'cause it felt right
        <br><br>We mixed the ennui and troubles, rhyming our discontent
        <br>And though it's history, I can't forget the time that we spent
        <br><br>Convinced that this could mean another end
        <br>Exists between real and pretend
        <br>A twisted alter-fiction where I missed my chance, did not ascend, and
        <br>Disappearing into the mist of "never happened"
        <br>Is the me that I can never befriend
        <br>I let it go
        <br><br>Fade in, fade out
        <br>This crazy dream
        <br>Without a direction, floating aimlessly
        <br>There's nothing left
        <br>Back there for me
        <br>Breathe in, but it won't stop the rain from pouring
        <br>We'd run
        <br><br>Right through
        <br>Those nights
        <br>I'll never find my way back to you inside this labyrinth of lights
        <br><br> There was madness
        <br>In the meaning
        <br>Never laughless
        <br>We were screaming at the top of our lungs to the numbness
        <br>This city never died
        <br><br>But was there ever a soul inside?
        <br><br>Chasing fireflies between the soaring high-rises
        <br>Left a trail behind, defined it "wasted time of our lives"
        <br><br>Silent singer, overworked and underpaid
        <br><br>Thinks an office is a coffin until off is where you're laid
        <br><br>Yet a thought persists, an optimist who ought to be afraid
        <br><br>Saw the "nothing wrong" in writing songs behind the lonely shade
        <br>Is the world a sadder place without the words that you conveyed?
        <br>When the ladder fell and shattered every bar that we had played
        <br><br>Does it matter in the end the sound diminished and decayed
        <br>And your friends grew tired of fantasy; you're wishing they had stayed?
        <br><br>You don't get to say "I miss you"
        <br>You watched your heroes fade
        <br>Into the rear-view mirror of the villain you portrayed
        <br><br>Stop the pity party, listen you don't get to be dismayed
        <br>You don't get to be emotional, feel blessed you got it made
        <br><br>These the best of years of life because you chose to make a trade
        <br>Recollect the days you hoped and you prayed for this
        <br>What is there to miss?
        <br><br>Fade in, fade out
        <br>This hazy dream
        <br>Without a direction, roaming aimlessly
        <br>There's nothing left
        <br>Back there for me
        <br>Pretend it's the end of a made-up story
        <br><br>I'll fly
        <br>No proof
        <br>Those heights
        <br><br>I'll never find another chance to say "hey, thanks for saving my life"
        <br>I was hopeless
        <br>It was stinging
        <br><br>Driving roadless
        <br>We were singing at the top of our lungs to the numbness
        <br>This city never died
        <br><br>I'll say goodbye to the soul inside
        <br><br>And yet somehow
        <br>There was romance
        <br>In our self-hate
        <br>"We've got no chance"
        <br><br>In this light maze
        <br>But let's hold hands
        <br>Through the night haze
        <br>We'll run so fast
        <br>'Til the school chime
        <br>'Til the train runs
        <br>We know it's time
        <br>We're the sane ones
        <br><br>Waking up now
        <br>To the real life
        <br>Let me daydream
        <br>'Til the next night
        <br>I'll keep waiting
        <br>I'll keep waiting for you
        <br><br>Waking up now, to my real life
        <br>Let me daydream, 'til the next flight
        <br><br>Drowning so long, I got older
        <br>Now the crowd's gone, is it over?
        <br>Is it over?
